# Blog Zero - The Making of this Website

**Disclaimer: this actually the second version of my website**

Creating this website was a journey of trial and error, and experiential guessing. There are so many ways to go about creating a website now and its very easy to get lost in trying to pick the "best" option. I wanted to pick a platform or technology that I could get up and running relatively quickly, while retaining control of how to setup the backend.

~~I had previous experience in setting up simple websites using php as the back-end (LAMP stack), and some front-end experience in js. For this website I decided to go with NodeJS as the back-end and heroku as the cloud host. I tried a few other cloud hosting platforms, but heroku was the one that worked in the end. Its still the early days, but I am hoping for this website to act as a place to showcase my work and the occasional blog about something I find interesting.~~

My previous website was setup with a *NodeJS* + *ExpressJS* backend. This website is a Single-Page Application made with *ReactJS* and *React-Router*. At some point in the future I wanted to move my content to a BaaS provider such as Firebase. This is probably *(definitely)* overkill for a simple personal website, however was a good opportunity to learn ReactJS and React-Router in creating a SPA (that appears like a multi-page website).

This blog entry is currently only implemented statically... so there is a long way to go ðŸ˜…. In no particular order (ul), this is what I need to implement to get what I consider to be a basic personal website:

- Move blog content to database, and read data from database to display blog
- Create a 'blog editor' webpage for myself (hosted on a separate website or just on localhost)
- Test out uploading a basic app or tool

Thanks for reading ðŸ˜ƒ
