Hi, I'm Vivek ðŸ˜Š

I started programming in high school and over the years software development has become like a "weekend job" I pursue in my spare time. I've created this website to get myself out there and visible to the public. It's also a nice way to learn about modern website development methods (albeit simple ones).

I intend to link my blog articles and coding demos here (usually a blog for each demo, or vice-versa).

Thanks for reading, check out my [blog](/blog)!
