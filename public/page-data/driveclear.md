# Drive Clear App

Drive Clear is an app I created to quickly check vehicle clearance along driveways and vehicle paths. This can be a time-consuming chore when done by hand, especially when you need to iteratively design driveways based on the results of the clearance check. This app allows you to see the clearance check results in real time while you're designing the driveway.

[Check out the demo!](https://driveclear.app/demo) The demo version is restricted to only 5 points for the surface, and maximum surface length of 6m.

Its also entirely on the web, so no installation required üëç. Users continually have access to the latest version of the app.

## How does it work?

### 1. Enter in your surface

Use the Offset Table to easily enter values that correspond with points on the test surface.

### 2. Select the Vehicle Template and Direction

### 3. Fine tune your design

Make small adjustments to the level to achieve clearance.

### 4. Export your design

Save your design and simulation as an image to attach to documents.
