# react-noteapp

This was an exercise in learning ReactJS to make a very basic Todo / Note taking app. 

[Live demo here](https://www.vivekr.app/demo/react-noteapp)

The primary features I want to implement are:
1. Simple form to add notes (each note will have a note name)
2. Delete notes
3. Re order notes using HTML Native drag and drop (I'm aware of library like react-dnd, but I wanted to create that feature myself)
4. Saving notes to local storage
