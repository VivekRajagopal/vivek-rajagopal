## Technical Experience

### 1. Fault tolerant event handling system - `Azure Functions` `CosmosDB` `Webhooks`

- Using Event Sourcing and Domain Driven Design approach, designed and implemented an event driven solution, where events can trigger creation of other events
- Implemented `exactly-once` event processing when using Cosmos Change feed
- Solution designed to be self-healing in case system must be taken off-line

### 2. Event Sourced Reporting - `Azure Functions` `CosmosDB` `Webhooks`
