**Disclaimer: this is the second version of my website - the first used ExpressJS for back-end routing**

Creating this website was a journey of trial and error, and experiential guessing. There are so many ways to go about creating a website now and its very easy to get lost in trying to pick the "best" option. I wanted to pick a platform or technology that I could get up and running relatively quickly, while retaining control of how to setup the backend and taking the opportunity to learn relevant industry skills.

My previous website was setup with a _NodeJS_ + _ExpressJS_ backend. This website is a Single-Page Application made with _ReactJS_ and _React-Router_. At some point in the future I wanted to move my content to a BaaS provider such as Firebase. This is ~~probably~~ definitely overkill for a simple personal website, however it was a good opportunity to learn ReactJS and React-Router in creating a SPA (that appears and behaves like a multi-page website).

In the future I would like to create a separate simple "admin" web app to edit and create new content for this website. I would also like to better integrate my _coding demos_ into blog articles. Currently, they are separated into different web pages with links to each other.

Thanks for reading ðŸ˜ƒ
