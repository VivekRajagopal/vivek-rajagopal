<h1>{props.pageContext.frontmatter.title}</h1>

I discovered Markdown quite late into my web development journey. Previous attempts at creating web
pages was to _hand-craft_ everything and manually place in all the **`<tags/>`**.

This is okay for small demos or prototypes where I wanted to get up a running as quickly as
possible. However, when I started to write these blog articles, it became an _enormous_ chore to
manually add the tags for paragraphs, headings, font styling and so on. A quick web search for
easier content styling led me to something called **Markdown**, which allows one to read and write
_styled_ content in a human-readable format. The written content is then processed to generate valid
HTML with all the tags for styling.

The content of this blog is written in Markdown format and passed through the
[Markdown-it](https://markdown-it.github.io/) Markdown Processor to generate all the HTML tags...
which is then rendered to your screen! Very easy to implement, and makes my blog content easy to
create, edit and manage. The blog content is essentially a giant string which is fetched by your
browser before rendering as HTML to the screen.

This means that I can eventually move my blog to a database such as MongoDB. My website will become
a shell for loading and rendering this markdown content. I would be able to dynamically edit the
content without pushing a new version of the website up to the webserver. Of course, this content
rendering method can be applied to all the _index_ and _about_ pages too. This separates the content
of the website from the logic and rendering, which allows each to be developed independently.
