This is an overview of parsing JSON with FSharp - it is not a step-by-step tutorial. For that I recommend reading Scott
Wlaschin's four-part tutorial on
[how to use Parser Combinators to parse JSON](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/understanding-parser-combinators/).

JSON is just a format to represent arbritrary data. But JSON is just text at the end of the day. How do we take a simple
string and parse it into a complex in-memory representation of arbritrary data?

## Parser Combinators

Parser Combinators are the logical building blocks in comining smaller, atomic units of parsing logic into more complex
data structures. This JSON parser assumes that the input is a whole piece of text representing the raw JSON. This makes
the atomic unit to parse a single character.

Take such an atomic parser;

```fsharp
let parse_n input =
  let firstChar = input.[0]

  if firstChar = 'n' then
    Ok ('n')
  else
    Error "Expected input to be 'n'"
```

The signature being `fun input:string -> Result<char, string>`

Let's make the parser a bit more flexible.

```fsharp
let parseF predicate input =
  let firstChar = input.[0]

  if predicate(firstChar) then
    Ok (firstChar)
  else
    Error $"Expected input to be '{firstChar}'"
```

Here `predicate` has a signature of `fun char -> bool`, which allows us easily create more atomic parser.

## Parse this AND that

Okay, something a bit more challenging. Let's try and parse an entire JSON `null` value. We need to parse each letter
sequentially, and we can do that by combining atomic parsers. Let's also make things easier by returning the remaining
unparsed input in the `Ok` path in `parseF`. And why not check to see if `input` is empty while we're at it.

We need to introduce our first `andThen` combinator. This combines two parser into one, and requires the first one to
succeed followed by the second.

```fsharp
open System

let parseF predicate input =
  if String.IsNullOrEmpty(input) then
    Error "input is null or empty"
  else
    let firstChar = input.[0]

    if predicate(firstChar) then
      let remainingChars = input.[1..]
      Ok (firstChar, remainingChars)
    else
      Error $"Expected input to be '{firstChar}'"

let parse_n = parseF (fun c -> c = 'n')
let parse_u = parseF (fun c -> c = 'u')
let parse_l = parseF (fun c -> c = 'l')

let andThen p1 p2 =
  let parser input =
    input
    |> p1
    |> Result.bind (
      fun (v1, r1) ->
        p2 r1
        |> Result.map (fun (v2,r2) -> (v1, v2, r2))
    )
    |> Result.bind (fun (v1, v2, r2) -> Ok ((v1, v2), r2))

  parser

let (>>>) = andThen

let parse_null =
  parse_n >>> parse_u >>> parse_l >>> parse_l
```

### Expanded Parser

The `null` parser we created above is fairly simple. If we write out the expanded code in english it would be something
like;

> Parse "n",
>
> > then in the remaining input, parse "u"
> >
> > > then in the remaining input, parse "l"
> > >
> > > > then in the remaining input, parse "l"

## Parse this OR that

Our next useful parser is the `orElse` parser. This takes two parsers and requires one to succeed.

```fsharp
let orElse p1 p2 =
  let parser input =
    let result1 = input |> p1
    let result2 = input |> p2

    match result1, result2 with
    | Ok (v1, r1), Ok _ -> Ok (v1, r1)
    | _, Ok (v2, r2) -> Ok (v2, r2)
    | Ok (v1, r1), _ -> Ok (v1, r1)
    | Error err1, Error _ -> Error err1

  parser

let (<|>) = orElse
```

Armed with the `andThen` and `orElse` parser we can build fairly complex parsers.

A single JSON value can be many different types; `null`, `true`, `false`.. etc. We can use the `orElse` parser to choose
between valid fully parsed JSON values.

In FSharp we can represent our JSON model like;

```fsharp
type JValue =
  | JString of string
  | JNumber of float
  | JBool of bool
  | JNull
  | JObject of Map<string, JValue>
  | JArray of JValue list
```

## Mutually Recursive Parser

One slightly tricky part of parsing JSON is the fact that model is recursive. A `JArray` is an array of `JValue`, which
itself can be a `JArray`. So how can we parse a `JArray` if we can't first parse `JValue`... which needs the `JArray`
parser?!

The slightly "hacky" way to get around this is to declare a dummy parser for `JValue`, that `JValue` and `JObject` can
still reference in their parsing logic. `JValue` parser is finally defined at the end to close off the loop.

```fsharp
let createForwardRefParser<'T> () =
  let dummyParser = fun _ -> failwith "Null forward parser"

  let parserRef = ref dummyParser

  let actualParser input =
    input
    |> Parser.run !parserRef

  actualParser, parserRef

let jValue, jValueRef = createForwardRefParser<JValue>()

// ... use jValue in other parsers

// ... finally update value in jValueRef to actual jValue parser

jValueRef := jValue
```

I wasn't a total fan of this method, and instead would prefer to use mutually recursive functions. This is totally valid
code in FSharp (copied from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3621208/10195374));

```fsharp
let rec f x =
  if x > 0 then
    g (x-1)
  else
    x

and g x =
  if x > 0 then
    f (x-1)
  else
    x
```

## Improvements

The final solution is the most basic implementation clocking in at a pretty light ~290 lines of code for the core
business logic. Performance was not really considered for this project. But I'm still curious about how well (or rather
poorly) it performs.

If I ever get time in the future, I'd like to benchmark this parser and see if I can improve on it. The first performance
improvement opportunity to explore is to try and parse more than one character at a time. This would allow an early fail,
or short-circuiting into a more specific JValue type.
