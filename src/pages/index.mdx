I like building interesting products and tools with code. I like working on all aspects from front-end, to back-end infrastructure and dev-ops. My favourite languages are `TypeScript` and `F#`.

I like to keep busy by trying out new frameworks and languages.

I love Electronic music / EDM, and immersive-sim style games like Dishonored and Deus Ex. I am a huge fan of simulation games like [Factorio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yLaYuuBWRM) and SimCity. I also partake in the occasional hike and gym sesh.
